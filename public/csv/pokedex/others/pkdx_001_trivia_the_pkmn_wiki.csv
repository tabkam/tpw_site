"• Bulbasaur has two main distinctions:
• Bulbasaur is known to be the first Pokémon introduced in the National Pokédex Order that is a genuine Pokémon.
• Bulbasaur and its evolutions are the only Poison-type starter Pokémon and it was the only basic stage starter to be dual-typed until Rowlet was introduced in Generation VII, with Grass/flying. All other basic stage starters are single typed (although some become dual-typed after evolution).
• Bulbasaur and its evolutions have the same species as Sunkern: they are all classified as Seed Pokémon.
• Bulbasaur's shiny was originally an olive green color with a darker bulb color. In Generation VI, its olive green coloring was toned down to more of a light green.
• A Bulbasaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Pokémon Black and White because of censorship.
• If a hack is used where a Pokémon can be transferred from Generation VII to Pokémon XY or Pokémon ORAS, that Pokémon will turn into a Bulbasaur with a random Pokémon's cry.
• According to Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida, Venusaur was designed before Bulbasaur, and the latter was designed based on the former."
