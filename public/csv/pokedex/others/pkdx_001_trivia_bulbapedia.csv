Bulbapedia
"• In the Japanese Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue, the international Pokémon Red and Blue, and the Japanese Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Professor Oak classifies Bulbasaur as the ""plant Pokémon"" (Japanese: しょくぶつポケモン) when the player is about to choose it as their starter, using the term while referring to its type. In the English versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, he calls it the ""grass Pokémon"".
• This also occurs in the first episode of Pokémon Origins.
• Niue released a one-dollar coin featuring Bulbasaur as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Bulbasaur on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
• Bulbasaur's evolution family is the only starter Pokémon to have the Poison-type.
• Bulbasaur's evolution family is also the only starter Pokémon evolution family to have each member appear at least once in the Super Smash Bros. series.
• Bulbasaur shares its category with its evolved forms and Sunkern. They are all known as the Seed Pokémon.
• Bulbasaur's number in the National Pokédex and the Fiore Browser are the same: 001.
• Due to the censor that prevents Pokémon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, a Bulbasaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Pokémon Black and White.
• In Pokémon Gold and Silver, Bulbasaur is programmed to be able to learn Charm through breeding, but no other Pokémon in the Grass or Monster Groups can legitimately learn it to pass down as an Egg Move in those games. In Generation III and IV, Bulbasaur can inherit the move from Shroomish by chain breeding. In Generation V onwards, Bulbasaur can inherit the move directly from Cottonee.
• In Pokémon Sun and Moon, Bulbasaur could learn Vine Whip at level 7 instead of Leech Seed. This oversight was later fixed in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.
Bulbasaur may be part of the inspiration for the naming of Bulbasaurus, a genus of dicynodonts."
