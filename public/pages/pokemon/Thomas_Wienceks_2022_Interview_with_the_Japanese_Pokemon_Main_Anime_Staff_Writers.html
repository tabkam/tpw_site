<h1>Thomas Wiencek's 2022 Interview with the Japanese Staff Writers of Pokémon the Series About the Journeys Series</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following is my personal website-based interview with the Pok&eacute;mon main anime staff writers about the Pok&eacute;mon main anime as of 2022.</p>
<h2>Interview</h2>
<p><strong>Q: You had declined to let some of the main characters' owned Pok&eacute;mon fully evolve. Why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: And any of the Garchomp fans were asking for Ash's Gible becoming his fully-evolved Garchomp. However, unfortunately, you had declined to let Ash's Gible fully evolve. Why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: It’s been so disappointing that Ash's Squirtle and Primeape, along with the rest of the Squirtle Squad, had not physically appeared in the Pok&eacute;mon Journeys: The Series of the Pok&eacute;mon main anime, thus far. Now I wonder why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: And why do you think that Ash hadn’t brought any of reserved Pok&eacute;mon, including the ones Professor Oak’s Laboratory, at Professors Kukui and Burnet’s home, Squirtle and/or Primeape, back in his party?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: It’s also so disappointing that Charizard, the one of Ash’s officially owned Pok&eacute;mon from <em>Pok&eacute;mon the Movie: I Choose You!,</em> hadn’t reappeared in the either next Pok&eacute;mon alternate continuity anime movie, <em>The Power of Us</em> and <em>Secrets of the Jungle</em>. Why? And what happened to it?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: What do you think will be the future series after Pok&eacute;mon Journeys: The Series, a Scarlet &amp; Violet anime series or what?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: Do you think that Ash Ketchum and/or his Pikachu will be back in that future anime series? If so, do you think that any of Ash’s reserved Pokémon, whether at Professor Oak’s Laboratory, at Professors Kukui and Burnet’s home, probably at the Cerise Laboratory (Mimey (nickname of Mr. Mime), Dragonite, Gengar, Lucario, Sirfetch'd and Dracovish), Squirtle and/or Primeape, will appear in that anime series? Why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: Do you also think that Jessie, James, Meowth of Team Rocket, along with Jessie’s Wobbuffet, will also be back in that future anime series? Why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: Squishy and Z2 of the two Zygarde from the XYZ season from XY series of the main anime were the protectors of the Kalos region, along with Ash's formerly owned Greninja. However, they had not actually reappeared in Pok&eacute;mon Ultimate Journeys: The Series. Why didn't they? And what happened to those Zygarde?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p><p><strong>Q: It is also so disappointing to most Greninja fans that you have declined to let Greninja officially rejoin Ash's party in Pok&eacute;mon Ultimate Journeys: The Series. Why?</strong><br><em>A: </em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
