A useful meteor smash; Similar to Jigglypuff's down aerial, it can be used multiple times to ensure that the foe is unable to recover. It has slow startup lag but minimal ending lag compared to other drill kills. Can combo into itself and up aerial easily. It also has solid shield pressuring potential due to its low ending lag.

It also has deceptively long range and intangibility while its first hitbox is active, further cementing its effectiveness out of shield, as well as the latter point allowing it to be used in pressure situations. The opponent can fall out of the move however, limiting its effectiveness against strong opponents. As a recovery option however, it does not go extremely high or far, it is fairly linear and it can easily be edgehogged, making it easily exploitable off stage overall.</td>

His head is intangible while its hitboxes are active, giving it pseudo-disjointed range, and its hitboxes reach behind Mario pretty well, though they don't reach forward as well. Lastly, it has very fast interruptibility for its strength at frame 40, and its damage output is also just enough to make it difficult for most characters to punish out of shield.

Effective for comboing into itself at low percents, and into aerial attacks from mid to high percents; however, the former combo can be escaped with the proper combination of DI and SDI, and can be punished on hit at very low percents. Unlike in SSB4, the move's altered animation results in the hitbox being positioned fairly high to the ground on the first frame it is active, creating a blind spot and making it fairly difficult or even impossible to hit shorter or crouching characters with the move.

Its quick startup at frame 9 makes it a useful out of shield option, as well as being difficult to react to if the opponent is within its range. His head is intangible while its hitboxes are active, giving it pseudo-disjointed range. Its hitboxes reach behind Mario a good distance but do not reach as far in front of him, thus having trouble hitting short or crouching opponents in front of him. It has very fast interruptibility for its strength, at frame 40, and its damage output is also just enough to make it difficult for most characters to punish out of shield.</td>

          <h3>Taunt</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Up taunt:</strong> Turns his back to the camera and gives a thumbs-up while smiling. The pose Mario strikes resembles a piece of promotional artwork first released for Club Nintendo, but without the wink.</li>
            <li><strong>Side taunt:</strong> Cheerfully tosses Cappy in a circle, saying "Woohoo!", then grabs him out of midair and puts him back on his head. Based on the Cap Throw from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Down taunt:</strong> Spins in the air and falls to the ground with his legs in the air. This is a reference to his dying animation from <em>Donkey Kong</em>.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Idle Pose</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjusts his hat.</li>
            <li>Moves his head from left to right and holds his fist in front of his face.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Crowd Cheer</h3>

          </table>
          <h3>Victory Poses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Left:</strong> Winds up for a punch and steps forward while punching in front of the screen. Taken directly from <em>Super Smash Bros. 4</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Up:</strong> Makes fire explode from his palm and strikes a pose. The pose is somewhat similar to his <em>Super Smash Bros. 4</em> artwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Right:</strong> Does a spin as he jumps high in the air and lands in a strongman pose. It originates from his "character chosen" animation in <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>.</li>
          </ul>
