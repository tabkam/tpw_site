    <strong>Megamaxes</strong> - Type of replacement successor gimmicks to Mega Evolutions, Primal Reversions, an Ash-Greninja Bond Phenomenon, an Ultra Burst, Dynamaxes and Gigantamaxes, an Eternamax, and Terrastal Phenomenon for Pok&eacute;mon temporary transformations that are as ginormously hulked up as professional bodybuilders and weightlifters. Body proportions of these transformations can be <strong>compact cartoonish</strong> (5½ head inches or under), <strong>semirealistic</strong> (6½ head inches), <strong>realistic</strong> (7½ head inches), <strong>super-elongated</strong> (10½ head inches), <strong>semi-gianormous</strong> (11½ head inches) or <strong>fully gianormous</strong> (12½ head inches). Fully gianormous transformations of these transformations appear to be gianormously sumo-hulking professional bodybuilders and weightlifters, but with their bodies as all extremely heavyweighted body muscle mass instead of fats.</p>
